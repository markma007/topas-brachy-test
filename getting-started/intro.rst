Introduction to TOPAS-brachy
============================

**The TOPAS-brachy extension**
----------------------------------

TOPAS-brachy is an extension to the Monte Carlo toolkit TOPAS_ which wraps and extends the `Geant4 Simulation Toolkit`_. TOPAS was designed to make Geant4 more readily available to both research and clinical medical physicists as well as to extend its functionality.
TOPAS-brachy further extends the functionality of the toolkit for brachytherapy applications. 

**Motivation for TOPAS-brachy**

TOPAS has been successfully applied to research in radiation therapy physics for external beam radiation therapy (EBRT).
However, more fundamental research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of radiation action, describe 
effects of oxygenation, intracellular signaling, drug-induced radiation sensitization or resistance and many other effects. 
Variations at the cellular and sub-cellular level, both for tumors and surrounding normal tissues, need to be considered. 
Such research is ideally supported by detailed *in silico* simulations at the sub-cellular level.

The goal of this work was to lay the foundation to a deeper understanding of the biological effects of radiation in order to facilitate new research at the boundary between physics, chemistry and biology. By providing detailed physics and chemistry simulations in combination with detailed representations of biological systems, such as cells and their nuclei, we aim to promote a mechanistic description connecting sub-cellular energy deposition phenomena to observable biological outcomes. We have thus developed TOPAS-nBio, an extension to TOPAS specifically aimed at the simulation of radiobiological experiments by modeling detailed biological effects at the nanometer scale. By taking advantage of the simplicity and reliability engineered into TOPAS while providing nanometer-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we have made complex code accessible to researchers who may consider using Monte Carlo simulations to improve the physical, chemical and biological description of their experimental design or data analysis.
